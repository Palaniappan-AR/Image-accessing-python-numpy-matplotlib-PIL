numpy - it is the library used to handle arrays.

matplotlib - it is the plotting library used for getting the image in pixels.

pyplot - it is a collection of functons in matplotlib library.

PIL(Python imaging library) - it will help in opening the image in coding environment

pic_arr.shape - this code of line will give us the (height,width,color channels)

		Three color channels are:
		RGB- Red Green Blue

plt.imshow(pic_arr) - "imshow" is nothing but image show from "matplotlib.pyplot library"

pic_red=pic_arr.copy() - just getting an copy of pic_arr so original data remains unchanged

Red->0
Green->1
Blue->2
pic_red[:,:,0]) - getting red channel of the image
pic_red[:,:,1]) - getting green channel of the image
pic_red[:,:,2]) - getting blue channel of the image
